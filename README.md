# Acquire Parts

3d printable parts for acquire. Board and grid pieces are made with openscad. Hotel marker models were made with fusion 360, but only the .STL files are here for now.

The `10mm-high-modifier.stl` in hotel models is for loading as a modifier in slic3r. Using it you can set the infill percentage of the bottom 10mm of the object higher than the rest, getting a slight extra weighting at the base. I'm not convinced it had any appreciable effect though.
